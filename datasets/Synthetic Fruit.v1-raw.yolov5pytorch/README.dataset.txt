# About this dataset

This dataset contains 6,000 example images generated with the process described in Roboflow's [How to Create a Synthetic Dataset](https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-create-a-synthetic-dataset-for-computer-vision/) tutorial.

The images are composed of a background (randomly selected from Google's [Open Images dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)) and a number of fruits (from Horea94's [Fruit Classification Dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/classification/fruits-dataset)) superimposed on top with a random orientation, scale, and color transformation. All images are 416x550 to simulate a smartphone aspect ratio.

To generate your own images, follow [our tutorial](https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-create-a-synthetic-dataset-for-computer-vision/) or [download the code](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/synthetic-fruit-dataset).
